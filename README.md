## Getting Started

To get started working on this project, you will need to clone this repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory you would like to clone this project to.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/good3n/glpg-emr.git
```

Enter the project directory

```
$ cd glpg-emr
```

### Working with `backend/`

This section is under construction.

### Working with `frontend/`

Navigate to the `frontend/` directory:

```
$ cd frontend
```

Install the node packages:

```
$ npm install
```

Start the Next.js development environment:

```
$ npm run dev
```

You are now working locally. You can navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` (unless configured otherwise) in your browser to view the application.

Please refer to the [Examples](#examples) section for examples on how to make changes to this project.

### Frontend Structure

#### Directories

`pages/` This directory contains React components exported from files. Pages are associated with a route based on their file name.  
`assets/` Assets is a container directory to organize styles, fonts, etc.  
`components/` Houses the application's components such as headers, footers, navigation, etc.

#### Files

`next.config.js` For custom advanced behavior of Next.js  
`postcss.config.js` For custom behavior of PostCSS  
`tailwind.config.js` For custom behavior of Tailwind  
`.babelrc` Babel is used for backwards compatible JavaScript. This file is for custom configuration.

## Git Workflow (Gitflow)

This repository uses the [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) method for workflow design. **Please note** that you are _not_ required to use the git-flow CLI.

### Develop & Master Branches

Instead of a single master branch, this workflow uses two branches to record the history of the project. The master branch stores the official release history, and the develop branch serves as an integration branch for features.

</p>
<br/>
The develop branch will contain the complete history of the project, whereas master will contain an abridged version. Other developers should now clone the central repository and create a tracking branch for develop.

### Feature Branches

Each new feature should reside in its own branch, which can be pushed to the central repository for backup/collaboration. But, instead of branching off of master, feature branches use develop as their parent branch. When a feature is complete, it gets merged back into develop. Features should never interact directly with master.

</p>
<br/>

Note that feature branches combined with the develop branch is, for all intents and purposes, the Feature Branch Workflow. But, the Gitflow Workflow doesnâ€™t stop there.

Feature branches are generally created off to the latest develop branch.

#### Creating a Feature Branch

Without git-flow:

```
$ git checkout develop git checkout -b feature_branch
```

With git-flow:

```
$ git flow feature start feature_branch
```

Continue your work and use Git like you normally would.

#### Finishing a feature branch

When youâ€™re done with the development work on the feature, the next step is to merge the feature_branch into develop.

Without git-flow:

```
$ git checkout develop git merge feature_branch
```

With git-flow:

```
$ git flow feature finish feature_branch
```

### Release & Hotfix Branches

Please see the following guide: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow

## Examples

This section will feature an example or two on making a change to repository.

## Linting & Prettier

This project is pre-packaged with linting and prettier packages in the root directory.

It is recommended to install the [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) extensions for Visual Studio Code. You can edit your VSCode User settings/preferences and set the `Format On Save` option to `true`.
